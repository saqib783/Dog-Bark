Dog Hover Interaction
This is a small interactive web project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When the user hovers their mouse over a running dog GIF, two things happen simultaneously:

A barking sound is played using the HTML <audio> element and JavaScript event handling.

A dog icon image appears on the screen, positioned near the GIF.

The project demonstrates:

Event handling in JavaScript (mouseenter and mouseleave).

Audio playback control using JavaScript.

DOM manipulation to show or hide elements dynamically.

CSS positioning and basic layout styling.

Use cases:

Learning how to create small, interactive animations.

Understanding how to trigger audio and image changes based on user actions.

A fun beginner project to explore the connection between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
